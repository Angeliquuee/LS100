# In the code below, sun is randomly assigned 'visible' or 'hidden'

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

# Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" unless sun
# equals 'visible'

unless sun == 'visible'
  puts "The clouds are blocking the sun"
end

# Unless is the opposite of an if statement
