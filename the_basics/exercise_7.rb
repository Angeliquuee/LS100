What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

On line two of the code there is a syntax error. The program sees a paranthesis ')'
for where a closing bracket should be using a curly brace '}'. This following error may be associated
with the creation of a hash or a block since both of these are situated in between curly braces.
