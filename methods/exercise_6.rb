What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

This error message is telling me that the I have the wrong number of arguments
from the method 'calculate_product' established on line 1. This takes in two
parameters, but we're only putting in one.
