What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2

We are assigning the variable x to equal the integer 2.
This will evaluate and return the number 2.

2. puts x = 2

This outputs 2, but returns nil, so it evaluates to nil.

3. p name = "Joe"

We're using the method "p" which will output it's argument and
return it's argument. This will output the string "Joe", aswell
as evaluate as "Joe".

4. four = "four"

We are assigning the variable four to the string "four".
Just like in the first problem, it will evaluate to "four".

5. print something = "nothing"

Print is just like puts, but with no line breaks. It will output
it's argument which is "nothing", however it will return and evaluate
as a nil.
