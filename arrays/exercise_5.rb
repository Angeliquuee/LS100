# What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

string = "Welcome to America!"

a = string[6] # The value of a is "e"

b = string[11] # The value of b is "A"

c = string[19] # The value of c returns as a nil

# When you reference an array index that is beyond the length of the array,
# Ruby returns nil and doesn't throw an error.
